Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

During the development of my web portfolio, my process involved first sketching out the layout and design on paper, based on a previous market research. Then I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework to create a responsive and visually appealing website. One of the main challenges I faced was making sure the website looked consistent across different screen sizes. I overcame this challenge by using responsive design techniques and testing the website on various devices.

Throughout the development process, I learned the importance of effective design principles such as consistency, usability, and accessibility. Also, I gained a deeper understanding of CSS and Bootstrap, and how they can be used together to create dynamic and responsive websites. I learned valuable skills that gave me the confidence to work on more complex web development projects in the future.
